# [Uncertainty Quantification for Expensive COVID-19 Simulation Models (UQ4Covid)](index)

The __UQ4Covid project__ develops uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques for models of COVID-19 in the UK.
The project brings together epidemiologists and statisticians to use high-resolution computer models for policy-relevant decisions. 

__Advanced UQ tools__ allow us to 

- rapidly re-calibrate computer models to respond to new data and changes in
  the evolution of the pandemic;
- efficiently evaluate different interventions such as temporary localised
  lockdowns, vaccination strategies; and
- accurately represent prediction uncertainties due to incomplete data and
  imperfect simulation models.

UQ4Covid is an __open science__ project. We use publicly available
epidemiological models and statistical software packages. Findings are
shared with the community in real time through a constantly updated list of
[vignettes](vignettes), contributed by researchers from different UK
universities. These vignettes document all analyses in detail and provide all
source code necessary to make the results reproducible.
