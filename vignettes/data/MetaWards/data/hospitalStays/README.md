The script files and data sources used here are to inform hospital length distributions by age.

Data are from the CHESS study which we are not able to share publicly, so we make the
code but not the data available.

To run the analysis, set working directory to this folder, and then the `hospitalStays.R` script file produces a file called `hospStays.rds` that contains a finite mixture model that can be used to generate design points for these parameters. By default this is copied to the `../../inputs/` folder.

Then running the `deriveLimits.R` file produces thresholds for the mixture densities that can be used to reject
points in later waves. The object `hospThresh.rds` is added to the `../../inputs/` folder.
