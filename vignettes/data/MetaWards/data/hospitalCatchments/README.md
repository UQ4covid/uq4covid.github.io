The `WD19toNHSTrust` and `WD19toNHSTrustSupply` shapefiles are generated from Rob Challen using his
NHS catchment area method. This also outputs the `WD19toNHSTrustCode.csv` lookup file.

The `hospitalCatchments.R` file needs to be run after the `../Ward2011toWard19Mapping/create2011to2019.R`
has been run and the results added to the `MetaWardsData` repository on the local machine.
